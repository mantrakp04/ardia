# Ardia on Windows

Windows comes before Linux, and both share one codebase with the Mac: no fork. The Windows work lives on its
branch (PR #1116) until the owner merges it. This file is
the plan and the state of the port. The request is issue #351.

## What is shared

| Layer | Shared | Language |
| --- | --- | --- |
| UI and app logic (`apps/browser/src`, `packages/core`) | Yes | TypeScript |
| Browser logic (ArdiaCore's shared core, `engine/chromium`) | Yes | C++ |
| Chromium and the patches that apply on every OS | Yes | C++ |
| The `ac_*` C API between the UI and the core | Yes | C |
| OS calls: windows, menus, secrets, glass, shaders | No, one per OS | Mac: Swift and Objective-C. Windows: C++ |
| The Mac-specific engine patches | No, each gets a Windows version | C++ |

Logic is written once. Only code that calls the OS is written per platform.

## The Windows app

- `apps/browser/windows` is the app project: React Native for Windows 0.81 on the new architecture, which is the
  only one Windows supports from 0.82 on. The Mac stays on the old architecture until it upgrades past 0.81.
- The UI is the same TypeScript. Metro bundles it for the `windows` platform (`pnpm -C apps/browser bundle:windows`),
  where `react-native` is `react-native-windows` and `expo-modules-core` is `packages/expo-windows`.
- `packages/expo-windows` is the API our native packages call (`requireNativeModule`, `requireNativeViewManager`,
  `uuid`), on Windows:
  - a module that has a C++ version answers from it (a React Native turbo module of the same name), one method at
    a time: a method it lacks falls through;
  - a method with no C++ version answers from `src/defaults.ts`, or with `null`, and logs its name once;
  - a view is either native (`ArdiaVectorIcon`, registered in `Modules.h`), drawn in TypeScript
    (`src/views`, `src/symbol`, `src/windowDragRegion.tsx`), or a plain view that logs its name once.

  The log, and `ardiaWindowsMissing()` in the JS console, list what the app has reached so far that has no Windows
  version, not everything left to port.
- Native code is C++ in `apps/browser/windows/Ardia`, header-only, one module per header, named as on the Mac
  (`ArdiaApp` in `AppModule.h`), all included from `Modules.h`. Events reach JS as the device event
  `<Module>:<event>` (`Events.h`). Folders come from `Paths.h`: data in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Ardia` or `ARDIA_DATA_DIR`,
  config in `%APPDATA%\Ardia`.
- Windows are the app's own (`WindowManager.h`, `ArdiaAppWindows`): one runtime, one window per window id, each
  mounted with its id, as on the Mac. Browser windows draw into the title bar and keep the system caption buttons.
  A drag region is a view that starts a window move when the UI's own hit-testing gives it the press, so a control
  on top of it still clicks. The app quits when its last window closes: it sends `willQuit`, then quits on the UI's yes or after 3 seconds
  without a reply; a no cancels the quit.
- What has a C++ version: windows, documents, config files and their watcher, secrets (Credential Manager), local
  telemetry, launch config and system info, file actions and icons, launch at login, the theme, lock and sleep
  signals, the clipboard, the bang list, confirm, prompt and file dialogs, the command table with its shortcuts and
  context menus, and icons.
- Shortcuts are the Mac's with Command as Ctrl and Option as Alt, except where Windows has its own convention;
  `CommandTable.h` holds both columns. The JS command catalog still shows the Mac keys in Settings.
- Icons are the web demo's set (`packages/demo/src/shims/web/symbols`), resolved in TypeScript and drawn natively as
  Direct2D geometry in Composition shapes.
- Without blur or gradients in Fabric on Windows, glass, materials and gradients are flat approximations until they
  get native views (Mica and Acrylic).
- The Windows native API has its own version: `WINDOWS_NATIVE_API_VERSION` in `platform/nativeApi.ts` and
  `windowsApiVersion` in `AppModule.h`. Bump both when the Windows native surface changes. A Mac bump doesn't
  touch it.
- `--log-file=<path>` makes the app write its launch log, React Native's log and JavaScript errors to a file. Each
  line is `<level> <ms since process start> <message>`.
- A background instance (`ARDIA_BACKGROUND=1`) shows its windows without taking focus and answers dialogs and menus
  without showing them, as on the Mac.

## Checks

- `.github/workflows/windows.yml` builds the x64 app on a Windows runner and runs `scripts/windows/launch-smoke.ps1`,
  which launches it three times and uploads each launch's log: a first launch (onboarding) and a launch with
  onboarding done (the browser window), each with a screenshot when the runner allows a capture, then a hidden
  self-check launch.
- The self-check (`--self-check`, only in an instance with its own `ARDIA_DATA_DIR`) runs
  `packages/expo-windows/src/selfCheck`: each area exercises its native code from inside the real app, and the
  launch fails if any check does. A new native method gets a check there.
- `platform/windowsModules.test.mjs` fails when the app imports something from `expo-modules-core` that
  `packages/expo-windows` doesn't export.
- Nobody can compile Windows code on the Mac: CI is the compiler. The Windows VM on shiv covers behaviour by hand,
  with an ARM64 build. Speed numbers and the x64 build need real hardware before a release.

## Speed targets

The Mac's numbers are the targets for Windows, measured from the first engine build on. These are 0.2.45's, from
`docs/perf/0.2.44-to-0.2.45.md`; use the latest release's when measuring.

| Measure | Mac |
| --- | --- |
| Launch to window shown | 451 ms |
| Tab switch to shown | 9 ms |
| New tab to first paint | 78 ms |

## Order of work

1. The app shell: the UI in native windows, with the app-side native modules and views. Done in #1112, except what
   the log still lists.
2. Chromium for Windows with the patches that apply as they are, then the first window with a real tab.
3. ArdiaCore: split into a shared core (`.cc`) and platform files (`_mac.mm`, `_win.cc`), then write the Windows files.
4. The Windows versions of the Mac-specific engine patches.
5. C++ versions of what is still drawn flat or missing: glass with Mica and Acrylic, shaders with Direct3D, import
   from Edge and Chrome, file drops, swipe gestures, Windows notification toasts.
6. Windows behaviour: Ctrl shortcuts, window controls on the right.
7. A signed installer and updates with WinSparkle on the existing appcast, as a nightly first.
