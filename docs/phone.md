# Ardia for phones (Expo)

One Expo app for both phones, replacing `apps/ios` (SwiftUI) and `apps/android` (Compose) step by step (issue #1556).
Screens, app state and the data store are TypeScript; what has to be native is an Expo module wrapping the Kotlin and
Swift code that already exists. Both phones run it: Android and the iPhone.

## Layout

```
apps/phone/                 the app: Expo 54, React Native 0.81.6 (the Mac's versions), new architecture, Hermes
  android/                  the Android project, checked in (application id com.ardia.browser.android, minSdk 29,
                            arm64-v8a and x86_64)
  src/                      the Mac's folder rules (docs/conventions.md): components/ui, components/<feature>,
                            state/<domain>, platform, lib
  ios/                      the iPhone project, checked in (bundle id com.ardia.browser.ios, the SwiftUI app's, iOS 27,
                            iPhone only, React Native's prebuilt core)
  scripts/gradle-locked     Gradle under the same lock as apps/android, so one Android build runs at a time
packages/phone/             @ardia/phone-native, the Expo module package
  src/                      the TypeScript side: PageView and its types
  android/                  the Kotlin side. Its Gradle build compiles apps/android/browser's sources, assets and
                            resources directly (namespace com.ardia.browser), so both apps run one PageEngine
  ios/                      the Swift side, pod ArdiaPhoneNative. It builds against ArdiaKit's ArdiaBrowser, so the
                            SwiftUI app and this app run one WebEngine and WebTab
```

`@ardia/core` is imported straight from `src/mobile.ts`; no bundle, no script engine.

## The page view

`PageView` (`packages/phone/src`) is the page. Android backs it with `PageEngine` from `apps/android/browser`
(`DevelopmentWebViewEngine` over the system WebView today). The iPhone backs it with `WebEngine` and `WebTab` from
`apps/ios/Packages/ArdiaKit` (WKWebView with the SwiftUI app's content blocking, popups, downloads and page requests),
in an in-memory tab store until this app takes over the SwiftUI app's data. Its tone is `PageTone.resolve` and
`ToneSampler` in ArdiaBrowser, the code the SwiftUI app's bar uses. The page takes iOS's edge swipes for back and
forward.

- Props: `pageId` (a page lives in the native engine under this id and survives remounts), `initialUrl` (loaded when
  the page is first opened), `toneInsets` (dp at the top and bottom to leave out when sampling the page's tone).
- Events: `onPageState` (`url`, `title`, `progress`, `isLoading`, `canGoBack`, `canGoForward`) and `onPageTone`
  (`top`, `bottom` as `#RRGGBB`, already resolved from theme colour, background colour and the sampled bands). Native
  sends both on one `onPageEvent` channel; the wrapper splits them.
- Handle: `loadUrl`, `goBack`, `goForward`, `reload`, `stopLoading`. `closePage(pageId)` ends a page.

`browser`'s `Omnibox.kt` (the ScriptEngine bridge) and `PageSurface.kt` (Compose) are left out of the module's build:
the Expo app calls `@ardia/core` itself and hosts the page's view natively.

## Build and run

```
scripts/agent/locked pod -- pnpm install             once, from the repo root
apps/phone/scripts/gradle-locked :app:assembleRelease   JS bundled in, app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
apps/phone/scripts/gradle-locked :app:assembleDebug     loads JS from Metro
pnpm -C apps/phone dev                               Metro on :8091 (the Mac's Metro keeps :8081); adb reverse tcp:8091 tcp:8091
pnpm -C apps/phone typecheck
```

Needs JDK 17 and the Android SDK (`local.properties` or `ANDROID_HOME`). The first build compiles React Native's and
Expo's Gradle plugins and the C++ of every native module, about 15 minutes on a busy Mac; JS-only changes rebuild the
release APK in about 2.

### iPhone

```
scripts/agent/locked pod -- bash -c 'cd apps/phone/ios && pod install'     after native dependencies change
scripts/agent/locked xcodebuild -- xcodebuild -workspace apps/phone/ios/Ardia.xcworkspace -scheme Ardia \
  -configuration Release -sdk iphonesimulator -destination 'generic/platform=iOS Simulator' \
  -derivedDataPath <your own dir> ARCHS=arm64 CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO build             JS bundled in
xcrun simctl install <udid> <dir>/Build/Products/Release-iphonesimulator/Ardia.app
```

The Podfile adds `apps/ios/Packages/ArdiaKit` to the `ArdiaPhoneNative` pod as a local Swift package; Xcode links
ArdiaKit into the pod's library and copies its resource bundles into the app. The app target must not link
ArdiaBrowser itself, or every ArdiaKit symbol is linked twice. iOS 27 refuses to launch an app without the scene
lifecycle, which Expo 54's template lacks, so `SceneDelegate` starts React Native in the scene's window. The first
build takes about 25 minutes on a busy Mac; a native-only change rebuilds in about 8 to 12.
